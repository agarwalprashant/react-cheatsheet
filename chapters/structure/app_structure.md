### React Application Structure

We are need to create 3 folders inside of `src` folder. 

Such as:
* `assets` (it'll contains images, favicon and etc.)
* `components` (it'll contains source code of components (`js` or `jsx` files, styling files, and file with unit-tests maybe))
* `containers` (it'll contains containers component, such as `App.js` file and another files that binding with `App.js`)
