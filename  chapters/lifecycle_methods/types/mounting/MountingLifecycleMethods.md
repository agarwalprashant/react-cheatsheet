### Mounting Lifecycle Methods

A component “mounts” when it renders for the first time. This is when mounting lifecycle methods get called.

There are three mounting lifecycle methods:

* `componentWillMount`
* `render`
* `componentDidMount`

When a component mounts, it automatically calls these three methods, in order.
