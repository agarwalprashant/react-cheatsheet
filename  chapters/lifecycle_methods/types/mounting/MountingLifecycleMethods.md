## Mounting Lifecycle Methods

A component “mounts” when it renders for the first time. This is when mounting lifecycle methods get called.

There are 4 mounting lifecycle methods:

* [`constructor`](constructor.md)
* [`static getDerivedStateFromProps`](getDerivedStateFromProps.md)
* [`render`](render.md)
* [`componentDidMount`](componentDidMount.md)

When a component mounts, it automatically calls these methods, in order.
